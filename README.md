# DSA-Data-Analysis-Project
##Final project for DSA Data Analysis Skill Training- Case Study 1

This case study entails analysing a dataset from RetailTech Insights, a company that provides e-commerce analytics solutions to sellers on platforms like Amazon.
About 15 questions have been highlighted to be answedred from the analysis of the dataset using Microsoft Excel.

I started with checking through the dataset and getting familiar with the dataset. Each product has a category and a product id(unique to each product). There was also information about the ratings and reviews given by the customers.

The dataset contained information scraped from Amazon product pages, including: 
•       Product details: name, category, price, discount, and ratings 
•       Customer engagement: user reviews, titles, and content 
•       Each row represents a unique product, with aggregated reviewer data stored as comma-separated values 
Total Records: 1,465 
TotalFields: 16 columns 

Afterwards, I proceeded to Pivot table in Excel on a new sheet. I carefully picked each of the highlighted points and selected the fields that were related to the analysis. For example, number 2: How many products are listed under each category? 
For this question, I selected the product_id and the category and placed the category on the clumn section and the product_id on the values section to be counted. 

for other calculations, I used features like: Summarize as, Sort by, Label filters, Show as ...

After creating Pivot tables showing the answers to each question, I did a little touch on the designs by changing the colous and other appreance settings. 

Then, I proceeded to create a new sheet for the dashboard. I used charts where necessary to give a pictorial representation for some analysis.

##BRIEF INSIGHTS
From the data, the top revenues to the company were from the Smart televions, smartphones and smart wristwaches. Therefore, to generate more revenue, emphasis should be placed on ensuring stead supply of these goods to enhance sales. 
There is also little or no link between the discount percenatges and the rating given by customers. The discounts are good but the ratings were not based on the discounts gotten. They werre probabaly based on the quality and the satisfaction gotten from the products.
Also , majority of the products got a good rating which is a good recommendation for the company's products.
